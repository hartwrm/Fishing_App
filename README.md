Going to be using this API:
Weather: https://openweathermap.org/api

1. User will enter their location or desired location.
2. App will reach out to API and using their weather forecast feature pull the results for the next 5 days (free service)
3. Possibly use open weather map?
4. API results for each day will appear in separate boxes detailing weather details for those days...User will carousel through days.
5. Each day will have suggestion for whether or not to go fishing based on given weather information.
6. User will be able to click on day and store in local storage, use as a "journal" to record results of days they've gone out.
