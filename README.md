# Fishing_App
fishing days app
https://hartwrm.github.io/Fishing_App/

Going to be using this API:
Weather: https://openweathermap.org/api

1. User will enter their location or desired location.
2. App will reach out to API and using their weather forecast feature pull the results for the next 5 days (free service)
3. Possibly use open weather map...not just the data but the actual map
4. API results for each day will appear in separate boxes detailing weather details for those days...User will carousel through days.
5. Each day will have option to add/remove day from their itinerary
6. User will be able to click on a stored day and record their results from that day.


Problems:
Using local storage to store each day data to create a journal.  Still have not resolved this issue.
